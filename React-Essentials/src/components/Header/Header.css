/*  since we have separated the individual  components into the separate files we can also split the css of each component next to its component file for more easier distribution and understanding of the code to be used */

/* However these styles will not be restricted to this component --> if we are going to use the header component elsewhere the same styling will apply to that particular component also 
therefore it is the limitation of splitting the css code like that it will not be restricted to our one particular component */
